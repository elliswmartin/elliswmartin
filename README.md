### Greetings! ðŸŒŠ

I have worked in cultural heritage digitization for the last 8 years. Now I'm studying machine learning and information law in UC Berkeley's Master of Information Management and Systems. Feel free to send any python / nlp libraries you're excited about my way!  

I still work part-time at Letterform Archive where I tinker with and automate digitization workflows whenever it feels helpful. I have previously led digitization projects at institutions such as GLBT Historical Society, Mills College Art Museum and Oakland Museum of California. 

I am a starboard sweep rower and love painting clouds. For more on my projects, visit [my website](https://www.elliswmartin.com).
