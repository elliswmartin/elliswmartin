### Greetings! ðŸŒŠ

I have worked in cultural heritage digitization for the last 8 years. Now I'm studying machine learning in UC Berkeley's Master of Information Management and Systems. Feel free to send any python / ml libraries you're excited about my way!  

I still work part-time at Letterform Archive where I tinker with and automate digitization workflows whenever it feels helpful. I have previously led digitization projects at GLBT Historical Society, Mills College Art Museum, Oakland Museum of California, and William Way LGBT Center. 

I row on the California Lightweight team (Go Bears!) and love painting clouds. For more on my projects, visit [my website](https://www.elliswmartin.com).
