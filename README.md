### Greetings! ðŸŒŠ

I have worked in cultural heritage digitization for the last 8 years. In spring 2024 I graduated with a Master's of Information Management and Systems from UC Berkeley. Feel free to reach out if you want to talk about the intersections of digitization and intellectual property law. 

I work at Letterform Archive as Digitization Archivist where I tinker with and automate digitization workflows and handle rights and reproduction. I have previously led digitization projects at institutions such as GLBT Historical Society, Mills College Art Museum and Oakland Museum of California.
