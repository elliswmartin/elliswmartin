### Greetings! ðŸŒŠ

I have worked in cultural heritage digitization for the last 8 years. Now I'm studying machine learning in UC Berkeley's Masters of Information Management and Systems. Feel free to send any python / ml tools you're excited about my way.  

I still work part-time at Letterform Archive where I tinker with and automate digitization workflows whenever it feels good. I have previously led digitization projects at GLBT Historical Society, Mills College Art Museum, Oakland Museum of California, and William Way LGBT Center.
